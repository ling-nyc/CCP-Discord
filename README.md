# CCP-Discord
A Discord bot written in PY with the Chinese "social credits" meme in mind. Keep in mind that this was made in under 25 minutes so it's incredibly low quality.

## A bot that will delete any messages involving the ccp, etc.

# Running

To start, simply clone the repository, and run `pip3 install discord`

Change the config as you see fit, and put the bot token into the env file.

After that, run `python3 main.py` to start the bot.

# Disclaimer: This bot is purely satire and does not reflect or intend to influence any political views or ideas.
